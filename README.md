### Discontinued
BricksVR has decided to no longer support the PC version as it takes up a very small chunk of the player base and supporting both takes a larger effort and slows down the release of future updates. This mod however was made for PC devices and I'm not sure if I can/should make a port to the Quest so I have decided to archive this mod.

### GENERAL INFORMATION:

- DiscordRPC client for BricksVR but credits to Darkcryi#7345 for giving me the idea to do it

---
Extract the zip and place  discord-rpc.dll **outside** the Mods folder.

Then put the DiscordPresence.dll **inside** the Mods folder.
